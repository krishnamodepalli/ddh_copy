    <h1>
      DuckDuckHack: Past, Present, and Future
    </h1>
    <p>Over the past five years, more than 1,500 contributors formed an amazing open source community called
      DuckDuckHack that, together, produced over 1,200 instant answers for DuckDuckGo. That's over 5,000 pull requests,
      250,000 lines of code and hundreds of squashed bugs! You can see all of those Instant Answers at:
      <a href="https://duck.co/ia" class="links">https://duck.co/ia</a>. This is nothing short of amazing, and we are
      extremely grateful for everyone who has
      participated, from the passing commenters all the way to our Community Leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all of its good qualities, though, DuckDuckHack is still too complex. The contribution process can be
      difficult and awkward. Existing tools and processes unfortunately do not fully support our vision of
      community-powered Instant Answers at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, <strong>we're putting DuckDuckHack into maintenance mode</strong> while we consider improving the
      contribution process.

    <h1>What's next for DuckDuckHack ?</h1>
    <p>
      DuckDuckGo is still rapidly <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html" class="links">growing</a> and we are
      grateful to know that, as we continue to grow, more and more people are eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to
      get involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re not sure what the next community initiative will look like, or when it will be ready to share with you.
      However, we actively maintain several other open-source projects, such as our Android and iOS apps, browser
      extensions, and more, which you can you find on <a href="http://github.com/duckduckgo" class="links"></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re very thankful to the many developers and Community Leaders who’ve volunteered their time over the years to
      DuckDuckHack and we hope to work with you all again soon!
